The **text editor** is a tool to view and edit .ndf text files.

Any .ndf file can be opened in the text editor by double-clicking it in the project explorer. 

A different file can be opened by clicking the *open* button in the toolbar or by pressing **Ctrl+O**. Changes made to currently opened file can be saved by clicking *save* (**Ctrl+S**). You can *undo* (**Ctrl+Z**) or *redo* (**Ctrl+Y**) changes with the respective buttons.

Use the *find* button (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) to search the file for specific text. You can navigate through the occurrences with the *next* (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) and *previous search result* (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) buttons. You can toggle case-sensitive search by pressing the *case-sensitive search* button (**Ctrl+E**)

The *replace* button (**Ctrl+R**) allows you to replace either the next or all occurrences of the text in the find bar with that in the replace bar.
