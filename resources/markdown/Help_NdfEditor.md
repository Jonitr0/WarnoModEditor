The **text editor** is a tool to view and edit .ndf text files.

Any .ndf file can be opened in the text editor by double-clicking it in the project explorer. 

A different file can be opened by clicking the *open* button in the toolbar or by pressing **Ctrl+O**. Changes made to currently opened file can be saved by clicking *save* (**Ctrl+S**). You can *undo* (**Ctrl+Z**) or *redo* (**Ctrl+Y**) changes with the respective buttons.

Use the *find* button (**Ctrl+F**) to search the file for specific text. You can navigate through the occurrences with the *next* (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) and *previous search result* (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) buttons. You can toggle case-sensitive search by pressing the *case-sensitive search* button (**Ctrl+E**).

The *replace* button (**Ctrl+R**) allows you to replace either the next or all occurrences of the text in the find bar with that in the replace bar.

You can duplicate the current selection, or current line of nothing is selected, by pressing **Ctrl+D**. You can also insert a Warno-formatted GUID at the current cursor position with **Ctrl+U**. To insert a string token of a previously added string, press **Ctrl+K**. These actions are also accessible via the context menu (right click).
