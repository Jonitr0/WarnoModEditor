<body><p>The <strong>file comparison page</strong> shows differences between two text files. It is opened by clicking a &quot;Show Differences&quot; Button on the <strong>diff page.</strong></p>
<p>You can toggle which files you want to view with the buttons in the tool bar. Like the text editor, the file comparison page has a <em>find</em> bar (<strong>Ctrl+F</strong>) to search for specific text. You can navigate through the occurrences with the <em>next</em> (<strong>Ctrl+Arrow Right</strong>) and <em>previous search result</em> (<strong>Ctrl+Arrow Right</strong>) buttons. You can toggle case-sensitive search by pressing the <em>case-sensitive search</em> button (<strong>Ctrl+E</strong>).</p>
<p>You can toggle if the cursors should be linked across both files with the <em>link text cursors</em> button. <strong>Make sure to disable this option if you want to select text.</strong></p>
<p>Text only present in the left file (your current mod) is shown with a green background, while text that is only in the right file (the comparison target) has a red background. In some cases, empty lines have to be added to keep the text of both files aligned. These are marked by a blue background.</p>
