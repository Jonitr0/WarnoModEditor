The **file comparison page** shows differences between two text files. It is opened by clicking a "Show Differences" Button on the **diff page.**

You can toggle which files you want to view with the buttons in the tool bar. Like the text editor, the file comparison page has a *find* bar (**Ctrl+F**) to search for specific text. You can navigate through the occurrences with the *next* (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) and *previous search result* (**Ctrl+Arrow Right**) buttons. You can toggle case-sensitive search by pressing the *case-sensitive search* button (**Ctrl+E**).

You can toggle if the cursors should be linked across both files with the *link text cursors* button. **Make sure to disable this option if you want to select text.**

Text only present in the left file (your current mod) is shown with a green background, while text that is only in the right file (the comparison target) has a red background. In some cases, empty lines have to be added to keep the text of both files aligned. These are marked by a blue background.
